- **Exchange Rate APIs** - Integration with ExchangeRate-API and RestCountries API
- **Country-based Defaults** - Company currency automatically set based on country selection

### Expense Submission (Employee Role)
- **OCR Receipt Scanning** - Upload receipt images for automatic expense extraction
- **Auto-fill Forms** - OCR extracts amount, date, merchant, description, and category
- **Multi-currency Forms** - Submit expenses in any supported currency
- **Expense History** - View approved and rejected expenses

### Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin Role)

### Conditional Approval Flow
- **Percentage Rules** - e.g., "60% of approvers must approve"
- **Specific Approver Rules** - e.g., "CFO must approve"
- **Hybrid Rules** - e.g., "60% OR CFO approves"
- **Combined Workflows** - Support for both multiple approvers and conditional rules together

## 🛠️ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Open: http://localhost:3000
   - Login with demo credentials below

## 🔐 Demo Credentials

- **Admin:** admin@company.com / password123
- **Manager:** manager@company.com / password123
- **Employee:** employee@company.com / password123

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Authentication
